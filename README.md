# Notes

## SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility Principles

- Every class in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, which it should encapsulate.

### Open Closed Principles

- Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principles

- Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

- Should involve abstract class or interface while dealing with polymorphism to avoid violating LSP.
